# Magic Patterns - Vite Template

This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://www.magicpatterns.com/c/ro8wims5run19cxqu5oqwq)

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Set your Groq API key in your shell: `export GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Start the API server: `npm run server` (listens on http://localhost:3001)
4. In another terminal, start the frontend dev server: `npm run dev`

The Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to the Node server during development.

## Image uploads to Groq

This template includes a minimal proxy at `server/index.js` that forwards chat and image prompts to Groq's Chat Completions API without exposing your API key to the browser. The chat UI sends:

- Text: as normal chat messages.
- Image: as a data URL (`data:image/*;base64,...`) using a Groq vision-capable model. The proxy instructs the model to return strict JSON for ID extraction.

Notes:
- Do not put your Groq key in frontend code. Keep it in the server env.
- For production, replace the placeholder vision model ID with a current one available in your Groq account.
