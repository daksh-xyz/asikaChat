Clomid & Monitoring
Clomiphene (Clomid, Serophene) is a fertility medication that is used to induce ovulation in women who do not produce an egg every month. Clomiphene stimulates a woman’s ovaries to help with ovulation, a process called ovulation induction.
Because Clomid increases the number of mature follicles in the ovaries, the drug also increases the likelihood of ovulation and multiple pregnancies
Who Is Clomid Suitable For?
Clomiphene is generally prescribed for couples facing female subfertility, including:
Anovulation
PCOS management
Irregular menstruation
How Does Clomid Work?
Clomiphene works by stimulating the ovaries to mature follicles, which can enhance the likelihood of ovulation and pregnancy.
Specifically, Clomid interacts with oestrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and blocks them. This leads to an increase in the hormones responsible for the growth and release of a mature egg. Cycle monitoring is essential during this process to ensure optimal results.
When & How To Take Clomid
Clomiphene is routinely given from the 2nd full day of the period for 5 days, and the dose may vary from 50-150mg per day. If no ovulation occurs after increasing the dose over 2 to 3 months, or if no pregnancy results after 6 months of regular ovulation, alternative treatments should be considered.
Ultrasound scans are carried out 2-3 times during the treatment to check the response and pinpoint the ovulation. Ultrasound scans are combined with urine tests and blood tests to enhance the chances of pregnancy. In some cases trigger shots may be given to improve ovulation. An ultrasound scan also detects if there has been an over response to Clomid.
Clomid is usually recommended for up to 6 cycles and should not be used continuously beyond 12 months. There are no human studies that show increased risks such as cancer associated with Clomid treatment.

How To Know If Clomid Is Working
Knowing if Clomid is working involves regular Clomid monitoring, including ultrasound scans and blood tests. Signs that Clomid may be effective include:
Regular ovulation.
Growth and maturation of follicles.
Increase in certain hormone levels.
Potential Side Effects Of Clomid
Generally, Clomid side effects are mild and rarely may need to be discontinued:
Mood swings
Nausea and vomiting
Breast tenderness
Headache
Fatigue
abdominal pain, bloating,
hot flushes,
visual disturbances like blurring of vision, double vision or seeing flashing lights.
Like all fertility drugs, Clomid can be associated with the possibility of multiple egg development and may increase the risk of having twins and triplets. There is no increased risk of miscarriage or birth defects after taking Clomid.
How Many Cycles Of Clomid Does It Take To Get Pregnant?
The number of Clomid cycles it takes to achieve pregnancy varies from person to person. It can depend on the underlying cause of infertility, age, and overall health. Generally, about 70% of women will ovulate within the first three cycles, and about 40% will become pregnant within six cycles.
Does Clomid Work For Men?
Yes, Clomid can also be prescribed for men with certain types of infertility. It can boost testosterone levels and sperm production, making it a treatment option for men as part of a
couples fertility test
and treatment plan.
Does Clomid Cause Weight Gain?
Clomid is generally not associated with significant weight gain. However, some users may experience slight changes in weight due to hormonal fluctuations or emotional factors.
Can You Buy Clomid Over The Counter?
No, Clomid is a prescription medication and cannot be purchased over the counter. Always consult with a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and prescription.
What Does Clomid Look Like?
A Clomid tablet is typically round and white, often marked with the dosage amount. The appearance might vary slightly based on the manufacturer.
