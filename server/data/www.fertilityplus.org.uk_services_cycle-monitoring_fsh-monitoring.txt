FSH & Monitoring
Women who fail to respond to
Clomid
are often moved on to the next phase of fertility medications. These are injections called Gonadotropins or FSH as they are popularly known.  The commonly used FSH preparations are, Gonal F, Meriofert, Menopur, Fostimon or Merinol.  Unlike Clomid, which aims to stimulate the pituitary gland, Gonadotropins attempt to directly affect the ovaries and stimulate follicle development.
What Are FSH Injections?
FSH injections, known as fertility injections, consist of FSH drugs that stimulate the ovaries to produce  eggs . FSH, or Follicle Stimulating Hormone, is a naturally occurring hormone that plays a critical role in the ovulation process. By directly injecting this hormone, women can improve their chances of releasing a mature egg or eggs during their cycle, thus enhancing the potential for conception.
Who Are FSH Injections Suitable For?
FSH injections are especially suitable for women who have irregular or absent ovulation, often due to conditions like
PCOS
(Polycystic Ovary Syndrome). These fertility injections can also be recommended for women undergoing
IUI treatment
or those who haven’t responded well to Clomid medication.
What To Expect At Your FSH Monitoring Consultation
At Fertility Plus, your FSH monitoring consultation provides a comprehensive overview of the treatment. You’ll discuss your medical history, assess your suitability for the injections, and be given detailed information about the process and potential outcomes.
How To Take FSH Injections
The injections usually begin between day 2 and 3 of your menstrual cycle and are recommended either daily or on alternate days.
Before commencing treatment, scans are performed between day 1 to 3 of the cycle to ensure there are no cysts on the ovaries.
Typically, 10 to 12 daily injections are needed to grow one or two eggs  each month.
A subsequent scan will confirm when the egg(s) are mature and ready for release.
Upon confirmation, a trigger shot (either Ovitrelle or Pregnyl) will be administered to facilitate the release of the egg(s).
To enhance the odds of conception, IUI (intrauterine insemination) treatment is often advised alongside FSH injections.
What To Expect After Your FSH Injection
After receiving your FSH injection, it’s normal to experience a range of emotions due to the anticipation of its outcomes. Most women report feeling a mix of optimism, anxiety, and curiosity. Physically, you might notice some mild bloating or pelvic discomfort, which is a sign that the ovaries are being stimulated.
Potential Side Effects Of FSH Injections
Like all medications, FSH injections can come with potential side effects. Common side effects include:
Mild pain at the injection site
Bloating
Mood swings
Headaches.
On rare occasions, women might experience more severe side effects like Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS). It’s crucial to communicate with us about any unexpected or concerning symptoms.
FSH Injection Success Rates
Success rates of FSH injections vary depending on individual factors such as age, the underlying cause of infertility, and overall health. However, when combined with IUI treatment and used consistently, many women report successful pregnancies within 3 to 6 months. Fertility Plus is proud of its high success rates and the number of families we’ve helped build using FSH injections, especially for women with PCOS.
What Happens If Fertility Injections Fail?
If the treatment fails to achieve a pregnancy or if the response to the injections is not satisfactory,
IVF treatment
is the next step.
