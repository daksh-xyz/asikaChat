Ovulation Induction, Monitoring & Test
Ovulation induction is a treatment that involves administering ovulation induction injections or ovulation induction tablets to stimulate the growth and release of an egg from the ovaries. This process is combined with monitoring, typically through ultrasound scans, to track the changes and assess the effectiveness of the treatment.
Who Is Ovulation Induction Suitable For?
Ovulation induction is typically suitable for women who do not ovulate regularly. This includes those with polycystic ovaries. For such women, combining ovulation stimulation with ultrasound scans, as well as urine and blood tests, may increase the chances of conception.
What Are The Warning Signs Of Female Infertility?
Infertility can manifest in various ways. Some signs include:
Irregular menstrual cycles.
Absence of menstrual periods.
Painful menstrual periods.
Changes in skin or hair.
Reduced sexual drive.
Note: It is essential to consult with a specialist if you experience any of these symptoms.
What To Expect At Your Ovulation Monitoring Consultation
During your consultation, the fertility doctors will discuss your medical history, menstrual cycle, and any previous treatments. You may need 2-3 ultrasound scans to assess the response to the medications.
What Types Of Ovulation Induction Are Available?
Clomid medication
:
One of the commonly prescribed ovulation stimulation drugs, Clomid, works by prompting the ovaries to produce more follicles.
Letrozole treatment
:
Often used as an alternative to Clomid, Letrozole works to stimulate the ovaries and is effective for many women.
FSH injections
:
These injections contain the follicle-stimulating hormone, a direct stimulant to the ovaries, helping produce mature eggs.
Does Ovulation Induction Work?
Yes, ovulation induction can be effective, especially for women who do not ovulate regularly. The combination of drugs used in ovulation induction and monitoring improves the likelihood of conception. Usually around 2-3 ultrasounds scans may be required to see a positive response to the medications.
How Many Times Can Ovulation Induction Be Done?
The number of times ovulation induction can be done depends on the individual’s health, age, and response to treatment. It’s essential to consult with your specialist for personalised advice.
Potential Side Effects Of Ovulation Induction
Like all medical procedures, ovulation induction can have side effects. These may include:
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).
Hot flashes or mood swings.
Breast tenderness.
Multiple pregnancies.
Headaches.
How Much Does Ovulation Induction Cost?
