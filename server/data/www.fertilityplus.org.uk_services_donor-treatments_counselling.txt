Mr Gudi and Mr Shah strongly recommend that all patients have implications counselling for themselves, their families and any children that may be born as a result. There can be emotional, relational, financial and social implications which counselling can help to explore so that patients can make well informed decisions about their treatment options.
Every recipient of  sperm, egg or embryo donation, as well as patients undergoing surrogacy treatment, is required to see the counsellor for implications counselling. Patients wishing to undergo
egg freezing
with the view to using cryopreserved eggs for treatment in the future are also advised implications counselling.
