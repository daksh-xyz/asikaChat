Pre-implantation Genetic Screening
Pre-implantation Genetic Testing for aneuploidy (PGT – A) represents the advanced stage in the evolution of
Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis
(PGD). PGT – A is a cutting-edge procedure that meticulously screens eggs or embryos for chromosomal abnormalities, providing crucial support for specific groups of infertility patients and those at higher risk of producing embryos with abnormal chromosomes (aneuploid embryos).
Why Opt for PGS?
The primary benefit of PGT-A lies in its ability to increase the chances of selecting embryos with the correct number of chromosomes. This precise selection process not only enhances pregnancy rates but also minimises the risk of miscarriage, offering hope and improved success rates for couples undergoing fertility treatments.
Understanding Reduced Miscarriage Risks
While there is promising evidence suggesting that PGT-A may contribute to reducing the risk of miscarriages, it is crucial to acknowledge that conclusive proof is still pending. Nevertheless, PGT-A stands as a valuable tool in the realm of IVF treatments by assisting embryologists in the identification and prioritisation of embryos with the highest potential for successful pregnancy outcomes.
PGS and IVF: A Winning Combination
Incorporating PGT-A into your
IVF or ICSI treatment plan
can improve your chances of a successful pregnancy. By focusing on embryos that are most likely to result in a healthy pregnancy, PGT-A ensures that the embryos transferred to the womb are those with the best prospects for development and growth.
