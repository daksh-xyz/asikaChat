PCOS Management
At Fertility Plus, we understand the challenges that PCOS presents to women in their reproductive age. With 15% of women facing PCOS, our expert-driven approach offers hope, clarity, and effective solutions.
What Is PCOS?
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, commonly known as PCOS, is a condition wherein the ovaries contain numerous small cysts. These cysts are egg-containing follicles that haven’t matured correctly due to hormonal imbalances. Understanding PCOS is pivotal to managing its symptoms and seeking appropriate treatment.
What Are The Symptoms Of PCOS?
PCOS manifests in various ways, including:
Excess hair growth (hirsutism)
Persistent acne
Irregular menstrual cycles
Infertility
These symptoms may intensify if one is overweight, but it’s essential to note that women of standard weight can also experience them.
What Causes PCOS?
The root cause of PCOS lies in the overproduction of male hormones, notably androgens. While all women in their reproductive years produce androgens, PCOS symptoms surface when there’s an excess, especially testosterone. The condition often has a genetic component, as it’s frequently seen in families where multiple members are affected.
How Can PCOS Affect Fertility?
PCOS can lead to irregular ovulation or even anovulation, making conception challenging. Additionally, the hormonal imbalances associated with PCOS can interfere with the quality of eggs released, impacting fertility further.
What To Expect At Your PCOS Management Consultation
When you step into Fertility Plus for a PCOS consultation, you’re placing trust in the hands of fertility experts. With vast experience and research under their belt, including significant contributions in India, our team will offer:
An in-depth review of your symptoms

How To Get Pregnant If You Have PCOS
Ovulation induction
:
This is a common PCOS treatment that stimulates the ovary to release eggs, increasing the chances of conception.
IVF treatment
:
In-vitro fertilisation offers hope to many PCOS patients, especially when other treatments might not be effective.
What Risks Does PCOS Inflict On Pregnancy?
PCOS can increase the risk of:
Miscarriage
Gestational diabetes
Premature birth
However, with adequate PCOS management, many women have healthy pregnancies.
Is There A Cure For PCOS?
While there isn’t a one-size-fits-all cure for PCOS, many treatments and strategies can effectively manage the condition. Whether it’s through lifestyle changes or medical interventions, managing PCOS becomes simpler with a personalised approach.
At Fertility Plus, we’re committed to offering holistic and personalised polycystic ovaries treatment, guiding every step towards a healthier tomorrow.
