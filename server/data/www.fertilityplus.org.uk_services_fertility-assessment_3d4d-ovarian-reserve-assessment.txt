3D/4D Ovarian Reserve Testing Assessment
Ovarian reserve testing is a critical component in fertility planning, especially for those considering In-Vitro Fertilisation (
IVF
). With advancements in scanning technology, a more precise evaluation of the ovarian reserve can be conducted. This information allows a tailored treatment plan to maximise the chances of success.
What Is Ovarian Reserve Testing?
Ovarian reserve testing
is a set of diagnostic procedures used to measure the quantity of a woman’s eggs (ovarian reserve). It is an essential part of evaluating fertility, especially when planning for IVF.
By assessing the number of antral follicles present ovarian reserve testing can guide the dosage of stimulating medication needed and predict the likelihood of treatment success.
What Is The Difference Between Standard & 3D/4D Assessments?
While standard assessments generally offer valuable insights into ovarian reserve, 3D/4D assessments provide an enhanced, more accurate evaluation. The 3D/4D scanning technology creates a more detailed visualisation, enabling an exact count of the antral follicles. This accuracy can translate into more precise treatment planning and higher success rates.
Who Is Suitable For 3D/4D Ovarian Reserve Testing?
3D/4D Ovarian Reserve Testing is suitable for women considering fertility treatments like IVF or those with specific fertility concerns. It is especially useful for women with conditions such as
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
(PCOS) or a history of poor response to ovarian stimulation.
What To Expect At Your 3D/4D Ovarian Reserve Assessment
1. Initial Consultation
During the first appointment, a comprehensive review of your medical history and fertility goals will be conducted. This information will guide the assessment process.
2. Ultrasound Examination
A vaginal ultrasound examination using advanced 3D/4D technology is performed. This non-invasive procedure accurately counts the antral follicles, providing a visual insight into the ovarian reserve.
3. Treatment Planning
Based on the results, a personalised treatment plan is created, detailing the required medications and their doses to achieve optimal egg production.
What Your Ovarian Reserve Results Will Tell You
The results from the 3D/4D ovarian reserve testing can indicate the expected response to ovarian stimulation, predict the potential number of eggs for harvesting, and guide the entire treatment process. It offers valuable insights into both the quantity of the ovarian reserve.
How Accurate Are The Results?
3D/4D ovarian reserve assessments offer higher accuracy compared to standard testing methods. While no diagnostic procedure can guarantee 100% precision, the advanced technology used in 3D/4D assessments enhances the ability to make more informed and effective treatment decisions, improving the chances of successful fertility treatment.
