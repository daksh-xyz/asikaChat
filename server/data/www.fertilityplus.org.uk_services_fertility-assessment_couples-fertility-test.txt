Couples Fertility Test
When you decide to take the life-changing step of starting a family, it’s essential to understand your fertility situation. At Fertility Plus in London, we provide fertility tests for couples that are comprehensive and individualised, ensuring that your unique needs and concerns are addressed.
Who Is A Couples Fertility Test Suitable For?
A couples fertility test is suitable for couples who are planning to conceive or who have been facing difficulty in conceiving naturally. It can be particularly useful for:
Couples who have been trying to conceive for about a year without success.
Individuals with known reproductive health issues or women above the age of 35 years.
Couples seeking to embark on assisted reproductive techniques like
IVF
.
Couples who want to have a complete understanding of their reproductive health before attempting to conceive.
What To Expect At Our Fertility Test For Couples
A couples fertility test is a combination of procedures and tests performed to assess the fertility of both partners. The goal is to identify any potential issues that may be hindering conception and to provide a clear roadmap for fertility treatment.
Female Fertility Testing
The testing process for women usually includes a
blood hormone (AMH) test
combined with an ultrasound scan. This process helps to assess the ovarian reserve, an essential factor in understanding a woman’s ability to conceive. This analysis offers insight into the woman’s reproductive system and potential fertility challenges.
Male Fertility Testing
For men, a
sperm test
is conducted to analyse sperm count, motility, and morphology. These factors are vital in determining male fertility. Understanding both partners’ fertility status is crucial in creating a tailored treatment plan that aligns with your goals.
What Happens After the Test?
After completing the couples fertility test, the process doesn’t stop there. We understand that the journey towards parenthood is filled with questions, emotions, and anticipation. Here’s what you can expect to happen next:
