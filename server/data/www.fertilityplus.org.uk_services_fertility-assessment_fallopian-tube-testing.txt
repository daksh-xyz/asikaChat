Fallopian Tube Testing
Fallopian tube testing is essential in the journey towards understanding and treating infertility. A crucial step in fertility care, understanding the health of the fallopian tubes can provide critical insights into any underlying issues that may be preventing conception. The Fallopian tube test is a procedure to examine the condition of the tubes and diagnose any blockages or damages. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about the test.
What Are The Fallopian Tubes?
The fallopian tubes are part of the female reproductive system, and they play a vital role in the process of conception. The fallopian tubes carry the egg from ovaries to uterus. It is passageway through which the egg travels to meet the sperm and become fertilised. Any blockage or damage to these tubes could interfere with this process and hinder natural conception.
What Causes Your Fallopian Tubes To Get Blocked?
Blocked fallopian tubes can be caused by various factors, including:
Infections:
Infections like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can lead to scars or adhesions.
Endometriosis:
Endometriosis
may lead to blockages due to abnormal tissue growth.
Surgical Complications:
Previous surgeries might result in scar tissue.
Ectopic Pregnancy:
A pregnancy that occurs within the tube may cause blockage.
Congenital Defects:
Some women may have a blockage from birth.
What Is A Fallopian Tube Test?
A Fallopian tube test, also known as a Fallopian tube blockage test or simply a test to check fallopian tubes, is a medical procedure designed to assess the patency of the fallopian tubes. It can help identify any blockages or abnormalities that might impede fertility.
Tests such as HYCOSY (ultrasound-guided dye test) or HSG (Hysterosalpingogram) can be performed without anaesthetics, while Laparoscopy remains the gold standard, offering a more detailed analysis.
Who Is Fallopian Tube Testing Suitable For?
Fallopian tube testing is suitable for women experiencing difficulty conceiving. Those with known risk factors for blocked tubes, such as a history of infections, endometriosis, or previous abdominal surgery, might especially benefit from a test to see if tubes are blocked.
How To Prepare For Your Fallopian Tube Test
1. Discuss with Your Fertility Specialist
Talk to your
fertility expert
about your medical history, any medications, and the specifics of the test.
2. Schedule the Test at the Right Time
The test should be scheduled after your menstrual period but before ovulation.
3. Avoid Certain Medications and Products
You may be advised to avoid certain medications, supplements, or douching products before the test.
Take some painkillers, either Ibuprofen or Paracetamol 30 minutes prior to the test
Avoid unprotected sexual intercourse prior to the test (from day 1 of your menstrual period).
How Fallopian Tube Tests Are Done
Performing HSG or HyCoSy
HSG or
HyCoSy tests
use either X-ray or ultrasound with a dye to check for blockages.
Laparoscopy Procedure
This surgical procedure offers detailed analysis and the potential correction of any blockages, requiring general anaesthesia.
What To Expect After Your Fallopian Tube Test
You may experience mild discomfort or spotting after the test, and your healthcare provider will guide you through the specific aftercare instructions. The results of the female fallopian tube test will be used to plan further fertility treatment if needed. There is small risk of infection following the test. The symptoms to look for are high temperature, aching limbs, or unpleasant and unusual vaginal discharge. Please let us know if you experience symptoms of infection to prescribe appropriate antibiotics.
