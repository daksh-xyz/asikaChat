Male Fertility Test
Male fertility plays a crucial role in the ability of couples to conceive. It depends on the quality and quantity of the sperm, and issues with either of these aspects can lead to difficulties in conception.
At Fertility Plus, we offer comprehensive solutions through a male fertility test package to assess and identify any underlying issues related to male fertility.
Common Signs Of Male Fertility Issues
Low or Absent Sperm Count
A low or
absent sperm count
means fewer sperm to fertilise an egg, reducing the chances of conception.
Poor Sperm Motility
This refers to the movement and ability of the sperm to reach and fertilise the egg. Poor motility can hinder this process.
Testicular Causes
Issues with the testicles, such as infections or injuries, can affect sperm production and quality.
Genetic Conditions
Certain genetic conditions can cause male fertility issues, including structural abnormalities in the chromosomes.
Blockage Along The Sperm Pathway
Any obstruction in the tubes that carry sperm can prevent them from reaching the ejaculate.
Who Benefits From Male Fertility Tests?
Anyone facing difficulty in conceiving may benefit from a male fertility check. Whether there are known fertility issues, a family history of fertility problems, or simply a desire to understand one’s fertility status, these tests provide valuable insights.
