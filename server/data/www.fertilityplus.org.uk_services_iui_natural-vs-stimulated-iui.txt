Natural vs Stimulated IUI
There are two forms of IUI:
Natural cycle IUI (without any hormonal stimulation)
Medicated IUI (oral tablets or stimulated).
What Is Natural Cycle IUI?
Natural IUI is the simplest form of IUI. It does not require the use of any fertility drugs. It is usually performed around the time of ovulation which could vary between day 12 and day 16 in a large number of women.
Suited For:
This is best suited for women who have a regular cycle where ovulation can be predictable. It is not as suitable for women with irregular cycles, since predicting ovulation is more difficult and it takes a longer time to detect it with a scan.
Procedure:
In those women having a natural cycle of IUI would be asked to come in for a scan between day eight and day ten to check for follicular growth, following which they would be monitoring the follicles using the LH test to check for ovulation. The surge of the LH hormone indicates that ovulation is imminent.
We generally prefer to give a trigger injection which would ensure that the eggs could be released and that if the LH test is positive, we would ask you to contact us as soon as possible, otherwise we generally would arrange for a scan in two to three days’ time to perform the trigger. The IUI is generally done the day after the LH surge when ovulation is likely to occur.
IUI Natural Cycle Success Rates
Natural cycle IUI, which doesn’t employ fertility drugs, generally sees lower success rates than its stimulated counterpart. However, it’s important to note that IUI natural cycle success can vary based on factors like age, the reason for infertility, and sperm quality. On average, the success rate ranges from 4-12% per cycle, depending on these factors.
The Advantages Of Natural IUI
Natural cycle IUI offers a range of benefits:
No Medications:
Ideal for those who want to avoid fertility drugs and their potential side effects.
Lower Cost:
Without the additional expense of medication, natural cycle IUI can be more affordable.
Reduced Risk:
Eliminates the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and minimises the chances of multiple pregnancies.
What Is Stimulated IUI?
Stimulated IUI may achieve a slightly better chance of pregnancy. This is by generally generating more than one follicle and though it would increase the chance of pregnancy, it also slightly increases the chance of multiple pregnancies.
Fertility drugs used are of two types, either using oral tablets or using injections. The oral tablets used are called:
Clomiphene
or
Letrozole
.
The injections are gonadotropins and these could be FSH and LH, the common names being:
Gonal F,
Bemfola,
Meriofert,
Fostimon and
Menopur.
Ovaleap
The use of these fertility drugs can be advantageous because they stimulate the ovaries to produce at least one egg in each cycle. This works extremely well in women with unexplained infertility as well as women with irregular cycles.
IUI Stimulated Cycle Success Rates
The IUI stimulated cycle boasts a higher success rate than the natural cycle, with averages ranging between 8-20%. However, like its counterpart,
IUI success rates
can vary based on individual circumstances.
The Advantages Of Stimulated IUI
Stimulated
IUI treatment
offers its unique set of advantages:
Higher Success Rates:
Increased chances of conception compared to the natural cycle.
Controlled Ovulation:
Medication ensures precise timing for IUI procedure.
Flexible Treatment Options:
Doses can be adjusted based on individual responses, offering a tailored approach.
What’s The Main Difference Between Natural And Stimulated IUI?
The primary distinction between natural cycle IUI and stimulated IUI lies in the use of fertility medications. While the former relies on a woman’s natural ovulation cycle, the latter utilises drugs to induce and control ovulation. This leads to varied success rates, treatment experiences, and costs.
