IVF/ICSI Treatment Preparation
IVF treatment
often takes place over a period of a few weeks and it is essential that you allocate some space in your dairy and avoid a very busy schedule to get you into a healthy and relaxed state.
We will give you a detailed plan for treatment, with a schedule of appointments. We aim to be as flexible as possible to with early or late times if required.
Before starting treatment you will need to undergo general blood tests and infection screening tests for HIV, Hepatitis B and C and Chlamydia. This is a legal requirement prior to starting the treatment per HFEA regulations.
A detailed discussion about the treatment will take place with Mr. Gudi or Mr. Shah and a set of information documents and consent forms will be explained.
