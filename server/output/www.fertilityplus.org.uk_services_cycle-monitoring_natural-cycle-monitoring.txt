Natural Cycle Monitoring
Ultrasound examinations during a specific time of the menstrual cycle enable mapping of the egg growth in the ovary and study of the changes in the lining of the womb.
What Is Cycle Monitoring?
Natural cycle monitoring consists of 2 to 3 ultrasound scans starting on day 7 to day 10 and helps to pinpoint the day of natural ovulation to enable the best chance of conception. It also helps to detect potential problems and sometimes answers simple questions.
The scans are often combined with urine tests for ovulation and laboratory tests, such as measurement of progesterone hormone levels, to give a complete picture.
Who Is Natural Cycle Tracking Suitable For?
Natural cycle tracking is suitable for women who want to understand their monthly ovulation pattern and improve their chances of natural conception. Whether you are just starting your fertility journey or have been trying for some time, cycle monitoring offers valuable insights into your reproductive health.
What To Expect At Your Cycle Monitoring Consultation
At Fertility Plus, our consultations are designed to make you feel comfortable and informed. Our specialist fertility doctors will guide you through the process, explain each step, and answer any questions you may have. You’ll learn about the significance of each ultrasound scan, urine test, and lab test, ensuring you’re well-prepared for the monitoring process.
How Does Cycle Monitoring Work?
Cycle monitoring revolves around a thorough understanding of your ovulation cycle. Here’s what you can expect:
Initial Consultation:
This is where we discuss your medical history, fertility goals, and lay the foundation for the monitoring process.
Ultrasound Scans:
Starting between day 7 to day 10, you’ll undergo 2 to 3 scans. These scans are crucial for identifying the day of natural ovulation.
Urine Tests:
These tests help corroborate the ultrasound findings and further pinpoint ovulation.
Laboratory Tests:
These tests, like the measurement of progesterone hormone levels, complement the previous assessments, ensuring we have a complete picture of your cycle.
Is Medication Needed Alongside Cycle Monitoring?
While natural cycle monitoring focuses on your body’s natural ovulation process, in some instances, medications like
Clomiphene
,
Letrozole treatment
, or
FSH injections
might be recommended for ovulation induction or address specific fertility challenges.
What Are The Benefits Of Cycle Monitoring?
Natural cycle monitoring offers numerous advantages:
Enhanced Conception Chances:
By understanding when ovulation occurs, you can time intercourse or treatments to align with your most fertile days.
Identify Potential Issues:
This process can detect obstacles or challenges in your fertility journey, helping us address them proactively.
Answers to Questions:
Whether you’ve always wondered about your ovulation day or have other fertility-related queries, cycle monitoring can provide answers.
What Are The Potential Side Effects Of Cycle Monitoring?
Cycle monitoring is a non-invasive and natural method, so it comes with minimal risks. Some women might experience mild discomfort during the ultrasound scans. If medications like  Letrozole, or FSH injections are used, they have their own side effect profiles, which our doctors will discuss with you in detail.
The monitoring process is carried out by trained doctors and nurses at Fertility Plus, 92 Harley Street on a private basis. For further information regarding cycle monitoring please download our leaflet
