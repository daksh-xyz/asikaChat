Tamoxifen & Monitoring
Tamoxifen is similar to Clomid in the effects on the ovary, but it tends to cause fewer side effects. It is a drug routinely used in women with breast cancer but it works very well when it comes to promoting egg growth.
It is given the same way as Clomid. It is taken between 20-60mg daily for five days, starting on the second day of the period. A scan is performed between day 10 and 12 to monitor egg growth and to predict when ovulation will occur.
Side effects are similar to Clomid:
Mood swings
Nausea and vomiting
Breast tenderness
Headache
Fatigue
Like all fertility drugs, Tamoxifen can be associated with the possibility of multiple egg development and may increase the risk of having twins and triplets and treatment can require cancellation due to over response.
