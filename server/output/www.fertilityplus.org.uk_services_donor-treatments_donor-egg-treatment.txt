Donor Egg Treatment
Donor egg treatment is a valuable solution for women facing challenges with their own egg supply, including low egg count, poor egg quality, absence of egg production, or genetic abnormalities in the eggs.
Why Consider Donor Egg Treatment?
Women may opt for donor egg treatment for various reasons. Here, at Fertility Plus, we specialise in providing personalised treatment plans to accommodate the unique needs of every patient. You may consider donor egg treatment if you experience:
Premature ovarian failure
Diminished ovarian reserve
A genetic disorder you do not wish to pass onto your child
Unsuccessful
IVF treatments
using your own eggs.
Legal Considerations in the UK
The UK law experienced significant changes in 2005, affecting donor anonymity. Since then, donors and children conceived through egg donation have the right to be informed of each other’s identities. This shift has resulted in a noticeable shortage of donor eggs in the UK.
Our Experts: Mr. Shah & Mr. Gudi
To navigate through these challenges, our esteemed fertility doctors, Mr. Shah and Mr. Gudi, have established partnerships with reputable fertility clinics in Cyprus, Spain, Greece, and the USA. These collaborations ensure our patients have access to ethnically matched eggs, promoting successful and supportive fertility treatments.

Fertility Plus goes the extra mile to assist patients in need of donor eggs. Through our international network of clinics, we help secure ethnically matched eggs, providing a broader selection and higher success rates for our patients.

Frequently Asked Questions
How does Fertility Plus select egg donors?
Our egg donors undergo a comprehensive screening process that includes medical, genetic, and psychological evaluations to ensure they are healthy and understand the implications of egg donation. We also consider the physical characteristics, educational background, and hobbies of the donors.
Is the egg donor anonymous?
Due to UK law changes in 2005, egg donors are not anonymous. Children conceived through egg donation have the right to know the identity of their donors when they turn 18.
What is the process of receiving donor eggs?
Once a suitable donor is identified, the donor undergoes ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval. The retrieved eggs are then fertilised with the partner’s or donor’s sperm in the lab to create embryos. If frozen eggs are used they are thawed and fertilised with partner or donor sperm. Selected healthy embryos are transferred to the recipient’s uterus.
How much does Donor Egg Treatment cost?
The cost of Donor Egg Treatment can vary widely depending on the individual patient’s needs and the specific details of the donation process. We recommend scheduling a consultation with our experts for a personalised quote.
Can I use an egg donor that I know?
Yes, you can use a known egg donor if she passes the necessary screenings and consents to the donation process.
How many eggs do I receive from my donor?
The number of eggs received from a donor varies. Typically, recipients receive a certain number of high-quality embryos to facilitate a successful pregnancy, with the exact number discussed during your consultation.
