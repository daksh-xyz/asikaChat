Donor Sperm Treatment
Fertility Plus offer donor sperm treatment only through Care Fertility.
Reserving Donor Sperm
Owing to reduced availability of donor sperm, patients may have a limited choice of donors, no choice (i.e. only one matching donor available), or be asked to postpone treatment until a suitable donor sperm becomes available.
We secure donor sperm through Care Fertility and we would ask patients to enquire about extended storage; Use for sibling sperm  and suggested quantity for further use.
Alternative Options
Patients who are prevented from undergoing treatment with donor sperm due to unavailability of donor sperm from the donor banks may wish to consider the following:
The use of a ‘known donor’ where sperm is donated from a person known to the patient(s).  Having sufficient samples in storage for future siblings can also be planned in advance.  All known donor sperm being used for treatment requires a six-month quarantine period before use. This process  requires extensive times and investigations .
Import of donor sperm from another country where donors have registered as ‘identifiable’ and with application and approval from the HFEA, these donor samples may be imported to licensed UK centres at Care Fertility. The process of importing donor sperm can take time. We would put you in touch with the sperm bank to secure the delivery if it is confers to HFEA conditions
