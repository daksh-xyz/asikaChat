Surrogacy
At Fertility Plus, we understand that the journey to parenthood can take various paths, and we are here to support you every step of the way. Surrogacy offers a unique and hopeful opportunity for individuals and couples who are unable to conceive or carry a pregnancy.
Understanding Surrogacy
Surrogacy is an arrangement where a woman (the surrogate mother) willingly decides to carry and nurture a child for another individual or couple (the intended parents). Upon birth, the surrogate mother graciously gives the baby to the intended parents, providing them with the invaluable gift of family.
Legal Guidance is Imperative
Before embarking on your surrogacy journey, it is crucial for all involved parties to obtain comprehensive legal advice. At
Fertility Plus
, we insist that our patients engage with legal experts to ensure a smooth and conflict-free surrogacy process. This legal consultation helps protect the rights and responsibilities of both the intended parents and the surrogate mother.
