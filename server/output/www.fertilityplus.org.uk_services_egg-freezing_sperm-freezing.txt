Sperm Freezing
At Fertility Plus, we proudly offer a specialised sperm freezing service tailored to meet the unique needs of our patients.
Who Is Sperm Freezing Suitable For?
Sperm freezing, or cryopreservation, is a proactive choice for many men in various situations, including:
Men Facing Medical Treatments:
Individuals preparing for procedures such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, which may affect future fertility.
Men Experiencing Decreasing Sperm Quality:
Those observing a decline in sperm count or quality over time can preserve healthier sperm for future use.
Pre-Treatment Planning:
Men who may have difficulty producing a sample on treatment day can plan ahead to avoid stress and uncertainty.
Post-Surgical Patients:
Those with surplus sperm following surgical retrieval methods like PESA or TESA.
How Can Sperm Freezing Help You?
Sperm freezing offers numerous benefits to individuals looking to preserve their fertility for the future:
Fertility Preservation:
Life events or medical treatments can sometimes impact fertility negatively. Sperm freezing acts as a form of fertility insurance, allowing men to store healthy sperm for future use.
Family Planning Flexibility:
For men who choose to delay parenthood, sperm freezing provides the opportunity to conceive at a later stage when they are ready to start a family, using sperm that was collected when it was most healthy and viable.
Assisting in IVF Treatments:
In cases where men might have difficulty producing sperm on the day of
IVF treatment
, having a frozen sperm sample readily available can alleviate stress and ensure the process proceeds smoothly.
Supporting Cancer Patients:
Before undergoing cancer treatments that might impair fertility, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, men can opt to freeze sperm to safeguard their chances of having biological children in the future.
