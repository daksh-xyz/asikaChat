Endometriosis Treatment & Management
Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (womb) is found elsewhere in the body, usually the pelvis. It is a benign (non-cancerous) but very painful condition, which is characterised by the presence of endometriosis deposits mainly in the pelvis (the ovary, areas around the womb, on the bladder and the intestines). Every month, these cells react in the same way to those in the womb, building up and then breaking down and bleeding.  However, unlike the cells in the womb that leave the body as a period, this blood has no way to escape.
Prevalence and Impact Of Endometriosis
Affected Demographic:
Endometriosis afflicts approximately 1.5 million women in the UK. It can target any woman in her reproductive years, transcending race and ethnicity boundaries.
Subfertility Link:
Endometriosis is a leading cause of infertility. Around 20 to 25% of women seeking fertility solutions globally have been diagnosed with endometriosis.
The Link Between Endometriosis & Subfertility
Endometriosis often leads to fertility challenges. However, research indicates that for people with endometriosis, fertility treatments can yield successful results for those wishing to conceive. Key factors influencing treatment choices include:
Early Detection:
Prompt diagnosis of endometriosis can significantly elevate pregnancy outcomes.
Surgical Considerations:
It’s essential to bear in mind that multiple surgeries for endometriosis might deplete the
ovarian reserve
. Therefore, surgeries should always align with fertility objectives.
Treatment Interventions:
Depending on individual circumstances, intrauterine insemination (
IUI
) or
IVF
might offer increased chances of conception.
Pregnancy and Endometriosis
A silver lining amidst the fertility concerns is that once pregnancy is achieved, it typically progresses in a normal manner, unaffected by endometriosis.
