IUI risks
When considering the
IUI procedure
, it’s important to be aware of the associated risks. At Fertility Plus, we want our patients to have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their fertility journey.
What Are The Risks Of IUI?
Ovarian Stimulation Leading To Multiple Follicles
One of the most prevalent risks of IUI is that the ovarian stimulation can develop into multiple follicles. When this happens, there is an increased chance of a multiple pregnancy, which carries its own set of complications.
Regular scans are integral during the
IUI treatment
, and at Fertility Plus, we usually commence scanning between day seven and day eight of the cycle. Depending on the growth and number of follicles, more frequent scans may be required to determine the ideal time for the trigger.
The Possibility of Abandoned Cycles
Should more than three follicles develop, the treatment will need to be abandoned to prevent the risks associated with multiple pregnancies. If the goal is to minimise the possibility of having twins, the treatment may be discontinued even with two follicles. When a cycle is abandoned, it can be disheartening, but the safety of the mother and baby is our topmost priority.
Potential Impact on IUI Success Rates
Every cycle brings its own set of variables. Sometimes, despite all the right conditions, the IUI procedure might not result in a pregnancy. It’s essential to remember that a single unsuccessful cycle doesn’t determine the overall
IUI success rates
.
Is IUI Safe For The Baby?
Generally, IUI is considered safe for the baby. The main concern stems from the potential for multiple pregnancies if too many follicles develop, which can pose IUI pregnancy risks. However, when monitored correctly, the risks to the baby are minimised.
Is IUI Safe For The Mother?
For the majority of women, IUI is safe. The risks involved, such as the development of multiple follicles, are usually identified early through regular scans, ensuring the mother’s safety throughout the process.
Can IUI Risks Be Prevented?
Close monitoring is the best way to manage and prevent potential IUI risks. At Fertility Plus, our dedicated team of fertility experts ensures that every step of the IUI procedure is closely overseen.
What Happens If My Treatment Is Abandoned?
If it becomes necessary to abandon the IUI treatment due to concerns over follicle development or other reasons, our team will provide a comprehensive consultation. We will discuss the next steps, alternatives, and address any concerns you might have.
Alternative Fertility Treatments
For those who face challenges with IUI or are looking for alternative fertility solutions,
IVF treatment
can be considered. Both treatments have their own sets of benefits, and it’s essential to discuss with a fertility expert to determine the best route for your unique circumstances.
